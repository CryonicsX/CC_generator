### How do i run this code

> *First of all you need to have a python on your computer. If you don't have python on your computer, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) *

> *After downloading, you need to open a new terminal in the folder and type.* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

> *After filling the config.json file, you can open the file named start.bat and start the script.*
